Hi, if you'd like to join the Model.earth team again, please re-register in DemocracyLab.org. We have a lot of exciting projects with a very active team: https://model.earth/io


Our next Model.earth team meeting is Thursday at Noon EDT

Hi, I saw your registration in our Democracy Lab team and thought you might be interested in working with us on our new Earthscape app. We're automating ML data visualizations within our fork of Chatbot UI, which integrates over 100 LLMs:

https://model.earth/earthscape

We meet on Thursday at Noon EDT, and again on Sunday at 10 PM EDT.
We also do focused meetups evenings, and Mondays & Tuesdays afternoons.

Our meetup link is here. (It's always the same)

Here's the template for the OPT letter.
Please adjust anything to fit your needs - update the start, job title, etc.



Hi again, we currently have 25 active team members.

Pick one of the 12 ML to-do and I'll loop you in with others involved in that area.

https://model.earth/data-pipeline/timelines/training/naics

Our LLM chat work will be taking place in this fork of Chatbot UI which will allow us to use NLP while interacting with 100 LLM APIs.

You can fork our Earthscape Chatbot UI instance:
https://model.earth/earthscape/app

And let me know your area of interest in our Data Commons repo:

https://model.earth/data-commons/dist

Looking forward to Thursday, thanks for getting involved!



What's your favorite LLM currently? ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, MJ or another? I've been using chat.openai.com 3.5 a lot to create code snippets.

<br>Feb 2024 - from Wes Ingwersen, US EPA Engineer:

Hi State Partners,

I’m happy to share that our report, supporting figures and all the data files for v1.0 of the USEEIO State Models are now published. [View Report](https://cfpub.epa.gov/si/si_public_record_Report.cfm?dirEntryId=360453&Lab=CESER)

[Excel version of 2020 models](http://doi.org/10.23719/1530076) for all states:

We have files with models for all states for a given year in a native useeior Model format on a public server as well.

We have 100’s of supporting figures [including maps of the U.S.](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.c.7041473) showing environmental pressure intensity grouped by indicator and commodity for all states and rankings of sectors by consumption by environmental pressure for 2020.

Please review the materials and let Wes know if you have any questions.
 
[The industry comparisons](../localsite/info/) draw on our EPA data prepared and presented using useeior (R Language),  useeio.js and the [useeio-widgets](../io/charts/) (Javascript and HTML using the USEEIO-API). Let us know if you have priorities and interests there and could provide us with some interactive feedback (testing) as we put that together.

As a reminder (and mentioned in the report) we’re working on Consumption-based GHG inventories (CBEI) for Maine and other Northeast states as an application of these models but the functionalities we develop and describe will be available for all States. We anticipate that being completed by early summer.

<b>EV Challenge Statements</b>  

1. Where are concentrations of electric and hydrogen vehicle parts manufacturers emerging?  

2. Where are combustion vehicle manufacturers likely to be impacted?  

3. How can we improve the visualization of supply chain inflow and outflow for local impacts on jobs, value added and the environment?
