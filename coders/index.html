  <!-- ATLANTA, August 20, 2021  — -->
  <!--<a href="https://www.georgia.org/georgia-centers-of-innovation/">The Georgia Center of Innovation for Energy Technology</a> is partnering with ... to launch -->The <a href="http://epa.gov">U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)</a> and <a href="https://www.codeforamerica.org/">Code&nbsp;for&nbsp;America</a> are pleased to announce the launch of tools for local communities interested in identifying areas for economic growth using 22 environmental sustainability indicators, including job growth, value-added, air quality, climate impact, energy, water, and land use across <a href="../../localsite/info/#state=GA">389 industry sectors</a>.<br><br>
  
  The <a href="../../community/challenge/" target="_parent" >Sustainable Communities Web Challenge</a> culminates on <b>October 2, 2021 with $10,000 in awards</b> using new embeddable, open-source web applications. 
  Also supported by the <a href="https://www.georgia.org/georgia-centers-of-innovation/">Georgia Center of Innovation for Energy Technology</a>, the challenge is open to community representatives, coders and designers who will compete in helping to shape and deploy the new tools with local, regional and national themes.<br><br>

  During the event, community app portals are being developed using new mapping and Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) tools to explore environmental and economic outcomes resulting from changes to levels of goods and services in the pursuit of innovative sustainable material management.  

Join in our upcoming work sessions for an overview of the web challenge and to start working on your community app entry.<br><br>

The project's community tools expand on development by <a href="https://smartcities.gatech.edu/index.php">Georgia Tech Smart Community Corps (SCC)</a> students who worked with <a href="https://www.epa.gov/aboutepa/about-epa-region-4-southeast">EPA Southeast Region #4</a> and the 
  <a class="c3" href="https://www.georgia.org/georgia-centers-of-innovation">Georgia Center of Innovation for Energy Technology</a> 
  
   during the summer of 2020 during which visualization tools were added to the US Environmentally-Extended Input-Output (<span class="c4"><a class="c3" href="https://www.epa.gov/land-research/us-environmentally-extended-input-output-useeio-models">USEEIO</a></span>) model of industries, households and the environment.<br><br>


 The online tools use the US EPA’s premier model for estimating environmental profiles of industries and goods and services that embody a life-cycle perspective called the US Environmentally-Extended Input-Output (USEEIO) model which combines local employment, industry levels, and geographic data to provide community-specific insight. The additions added during the challenge will include analyzing changes in industry input and output for use by businesses, community planners, teachers and students through a collection of modules that can be added to any website.<br>


<h3 style="margin-top:30px; line-height:1.6em">US Environmentally-Extended <span style="white-space:nowrap;">Input-Output Model (USEEIO)</span></h3>

 <a href="../charts/">Embeddable input-output widgets</a> use data precompiled by the EPA from dozens of sources, including the US Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) and the US Department of Commerce, to provide environmental and economic insights for hundreds of industries. Amazon is among the companies using USEEIO data to set goals for reducing their carbon footprint to net zero.</p>

  <h3>Coders are competing for $10,000 in awards</h3>

  <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Programmers and data analysts will compete for $10,000 in awards in our Sustainable Communities Web Challenge using environmentally-extended input-output interfaces developed by the EPA. While putting technology to work for local communities, participants will help identify opportunities to create circular economies that create jobs related to sustainable material management.</span></p>
  -->

   

<!--
  <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Awards will range from $500 to $2,500. Project pitches made during the October 25th awards ceremony will provide participants with an opportunity to earn an additional $2,000 for further code implementations conducted after the competition. Coding languages and frameworks currently used in the project include JQuery, React, D3, Python, R Language and Leaflet maps.</span></p>

  <p><a href="https://www.epa.gov/sciencematters/epa-researchers-working-improve-life-cycle-assessment-capabilities-communities">The Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) model</a> of goods and services was created by the EPA in support of Sustainable Materials Management. The model is in use by experts in industry, academia (24+ U.S. universities), the nonprofit sector, and other federal agencies. In 2019, the Georgia Center of Innovation for Energy Technology began partnering with the EPA Region 4 to develop the country&rsquo;s first state version of the national USEEIO model, which now provides the Application Programming Interface (API) for the current Web Challenge. Additional states will use the new online tools and widgets in the year ahead.</p>
