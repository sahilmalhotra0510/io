The US EPA is creating [input-output tools](../../community/tools/) for communities pursuing projects involving waste-to-energy, bioproducts, green energy innovations, [farm fresh produce](../../localsite/info/#show=farmfresh&state=GA), and local environmental projects. Community participants can include a coalition of representatives of diverse interests such as:

- local government
- educational institutions
- development authorities
- regional commissions
- local industry groups
- local citizen groups
- local non-profits   
- local religious organizations

## Community Focused Apps

The [Location Modeling Repo](../../apps/) contains starters for local topic pages:
- <a href="../../apps/carbon/">Carbon Cycle</a>
- <a href="../../apps/coastal/">Coastal Recycling</a>
- <a href="../../apps/ev/">EV Manufacturing</a>
