# For Local Communities

<!--
Innovative Web Applications for&nbsp;States&nbsp;and&nbsp;Communities 
-->

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Georgia Center for Innovation for Energy Technology have teamed up with DemocracyLab Volunteers to provide collaborative tools for visualizing [environmental and economic impacts](/localsite/info/) in local communities, states and countries using 24 indicators - including job growth, value-added, air quality, energy use, water use, land use, biodiversity, local conservation projects and [global development goals](https://sdgs.un.org/goals). 

<!--
Using an economy-wide input-output model of industries, households and the environment, the impact tools help communities identify opportunities for economic growth and environmental improvements.

## Community Pages

<!-- Starting points for updating your website with lifecycle tools.-->

Samples of tools you can add to your website:

<!--

## Opportunities for Innovation

- Create an economic development page for weighing outcomes during community decision-making that includes environmental aspects, quality job creation, land and water use, health impacts and value-added contributions to the state and county tax base.

- Look in depth at your state and community's total footprint while evaluating prospective industries and the potential jobs they could directly and indirectly create, while looking at their potential environmental performance.
 
- Determine how technological improvements in your community's industries, utilities, or consumption patterns could transform local outcomes in favor of cleaner air, water, land conservation and biodiversity.


## Other Resources Include

- [Teaching Tools&nbsp;and&nbsp;Student Research Framework](../learn) - Use and create applications to learn about the connections between industries, households, and the environment in local communities.

- [The Innovation Economy](https://hbr.org/podcast/2019/04/the-innovation-economy) - Economist Mariana Mazzucato talks about Entrepreneurial Ecosystems.

- [Community Carbon Cycling](../../community/carbon-capture/) - How manufacturers and municipalities are reusing material to capture carbon and generate clean energy.  


## Impact Visualizations

[Our lifecycle tools](../../community/tools/) explore topics of biodiversity, energy innovation, [farm fresh produce](../../localsite/info/#show=farmfresh&state=GA), waste-to-energy, bioproducts and local product footprints. Community participants include collaborations across organizations, including:

- local government
- educational institutions
- development authorities
- regional commissions
- religious organizations
- local industry groups
- local non-profits   


## Community Focused Apps

The [Location Apps Repo](../../apps/) contains starters for local topics including:
- <a href="../../apps/carbon/">Carbon Cycle</a>
- <a href="../../apps/coastal/">Coastal Recycling</a>
- <a href="../../apps/ev/">EV Manufacturing</a>
- <a href="../../recycling/">B2B Recycling</a>
