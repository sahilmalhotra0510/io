## USEEIO React Widgets

[View documentation and functions](https://msrocka.github.io/useeio-widget-builds/apidoc/) generated using [TypeDoc](https://typedoc.org/).  Learn about [USEEIO API Industry Data](../about/api/)  

The React widgets in the [io repo](https://github.com/modelearth/io/) originate from the EPA's [USEEIO-widgets repo](https://github.com/USEPA/useeio-widgets/).   
[The build folder](../build) is copied from USEEIO-widgets into the io repo to provide a static copy of the API's json files.  
The io repo includes additional code for integrating widgets.

<!--
If your local widgets reference the "useeio" folder, they may need to be updated occasionally as parameters change. For stability, point your local widgets at one of the [numbered backups](https://model.earth/eeio/build.2020.002) or copy the useeio folder into your project.

# Add or Edit Widgets

## Option 1: Embed Widgets, Edit Javascript

You can set parameters in the URL or javascript to control the display of the widgets.  [View examples](../../apps/).

[Github.com/modelearth/io](https://github.com/modelearth/io/) contains a built copy of the "[build](../build)" folder from [useeio-widgets](https://github.com/usepa/useeio-widgets), plus extra JQuery widgets.  

[Clone or fork](https://github.com/modelearth/localsite/) our [localsite framework](../../localsite/) for maps and navigation.  

You can create pages in the [apps repo](https://github.com/modelearth/apps/).


## Option 2: Build and Edit React Widgets Locally

You can build the USEEIO React widgets locally.  
Start with the following repo: [USEEIO-widgets repo](https://github.com/USEPA/useeio-widgets/) which contains only React widgets   




If you use the "io" repo, also clone the [https://github.com/localsite/localsite](https://github.com/localsite/localsite) repo and place it adjacent to the "io" repo.  Here's more info on [hosting the Localsite Framework on your computer](../../localsite/start/).



<!--

To avoid, the "localsite/build" folder contains the recent code from [Recent build 2](https://thetisiboth.github.io/useeio-widget-builds/).
-->

### Steps for Building React Widgets
To build the React widgets locally you'll need a current version of
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed. Make sure that the `node` and `npm`
commands are available in your systems path (you can test this via `node -v` and
`npm -v` on the command line which should give you the respective version of
these tools). 

Open a terminal or VS Code:     

A. You can right-click the repo folder and choose "New Terminal at Folder" on a Mac.  

B. Or you can open the folder from VS Code.  (Shortcut for opening VS Code: Open a command prompt in the repo folder and type `code .`  (This may be necessary if your build does not run when opening with File > Open.) You may need to [Configure your VS Code Editor](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/setup-overview) so running `code .` launches the editor.  Avoid running in the parent folder containing your repo(s) or your VS Code editor may not allow you to run subsequent commands inside its terminal.  

To open a command shell window within VS Code by typing (Ctrl + \` backtick) or go to the "View > Terminal". 

<!--

```
cd io
```

Or use <code>cd useeio-widgets</code> if you are just using the source repo.  
-->

#### Install Node.js Modules  

The following will add a node_modules folder containing javascript source libraries (dependencies) that will be used to output code for the widgets.  

```
npm install
```

<!--
You can ignore errors (about 11), including "Error: `gyp` failed with exit code: 1".  

If you receive a "high severity vulnerabilities" warning, run the following as advised:  

	npm audit fix
-->
<!--
pre-React and with React, ignored:
	`gyp` failed with exit code: 1
-->
Then build the widget libraries. If you are using the "io" repo you'll already have a pre-built "build" folder.

<!--
<span style="background:red; padding:3px; color:#fff">NOTE:</span> We recommend avoiding running the following build command. The code in the useeio-widgets repo currently causes a runaway processor in the browser when used with the "localsite" repo. To avoid, the "localsite/build" folder contains the recent code from [Recent build 2](https://thetisiboth.github.io/useeio-widget-builds/).
-->

```
npm run build
```

This will create or update the `build` folder and a `lib` sub-folder containing small JavaScript libraries used by the USEEIO widgets.  

Once built, the `build` folder contains [example HTML files](https://model.earth/io/build/) that demonstrate the usage of these widgets.  

### Generate Local JSON files from API

You can skip this step since we've already populated the **io/build/api folder** for you by generating static .json files from the staging API.

To provide data for the hosted widgets, we've download from the Staging instance of the
[USEEIO API](https://github.com/USEPA/USEEIO_API) via the following:

```
npm run download -- --endpoint https://smmtool.app.cloud.gov/api
```
Running the above mirrors data API into the static json files in the `build/api` folder. There are two subfolders for each model: national USEEIO and state GAUSEEIO for Georgia (and a third for upcoming v2 data).  

Sometimes we have to run the command above a second time to populate build/api/GAUSEEIO/demands table. (Aug 2020)  

Note: Every 90 days the staging server requires a reboot, email the [contact person](https://github.com/USEPA/USEEIO_API/wiki/People#Contact) to restart.  
If the '/api' address returns 404, you can use the staging 
<a href="https://smmtool.app.cloud.gov/" target="_blank">endpoint overview</a> to see if it is online.  

You may optionall [request the key](https://github.com/USEPA/USEEIO_API/wiki/Use-the-API) to the production API to run the following (Interns may use the key in our Google Sheet):  

```
npm run download -- --endpoint https://api.edap-cluster.com/useeio/api --apikey [Add API key here]
```
<div class="local" style="display:none;">
The production API requires an API key<!-- there is probably not a URL format-->
<a href="https://api.edap-cluster.com/?x-api-key=" target="_blank">endpoint overview</a>
</div>
Learn more about [using the USEEIO API](https://github.com/USEPA/USEEIO_API/wiki/Use-the-API)

Important: After generating build/api folder from the production API:  
<!--
1. Duplicate USEEIOv1.2 to USEEIO for existing script in non-React widgets.  
2. Duplicate USEEIOv1.2 to GAUSEEIO since GA data currently only resides on the staging server.  

Manually copy the GAUSEEIO to a new folder called USEEIOv1.2 for Inflow-Outflow Chart  
-->

Replace USEEIOv1.2 with USEEIOv2.0 (in sector_list.html)

You now have two options for viewing the widgets locally.

<b>Option 1:</b> Start a server using the command <code>npm run server</code>. 
Then open the default port (8080) at http://localhost:8080 in your browser to see the widgets.  Your command window will become inoperable since it is running a server.  Open a new command window (by clicking plus) to issue further commands.  

<b>Option 2:</b> View at the following URL if the "io" folder resides in your webroot. (Your port number may differ.) 

[http://localhost:8887/io/build](http://localhost:8887/io/build)  

If you are working in a direct fork of the "useeio-widgets" repo, view here:  

[http://localhost:8887/useeio-widgets/build](http://localhost:8887/useeio-widgets/build)  

Use the up-arrow to run the build line after making a change.  

	npm run build



View the output of your build at [http://localhost:8887/io/build](http://localhost:8887/io/build) 

Learn more in the VS Code [Node.js Tutorial](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/nodejs/nodejs-tutorial). 

### You may also contribute to the USEEIO-widget repo directly

To make updates in the NodeJS source code, fork the [USEEIO-widgets](https://github.com/USEPA/useeio-widgets/) repo and save in your local webroot (where you've [pointed](../../localsite/start/) http://localhost:8887/)  

Edit the files that reside in useeio-widgets/src. (Avoid editing files in useeio-widgets/build, these will be overwritten when you run the build.) 

Build when editing - [Amplify React App](../../aws/amplify/) uses `npm start` to build on-the-fly.  
Another option: [LiveReload](https://www.logicbig.com/tutorials/misc/typescript/project-auto-refresh-with-live-reload.html) might refresh your browser as you edit.  
Install using the [Extension Marketplace](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-gallery)  (Please update our documentation, not yet confirmed). 

Get under the hood! Mess with our [Python Samples](../../community/resources/useeio) and 
[add a new technology to the matrix using RStudio](../naics).

## FAQs

### Why are some values in the demand vector $0 (blank)?

In some cases there is no final demand for the respective commodity and the production of that commodity is only driven by intermediate industry transactions (note that there are different demand vectors in the model and that the selected demand can be controlled via the configuration attributes). 


### How is code formatting enforced?

The `.editorconfig` file contains the formatting settings. Modern editors have plugins for checking EditorConfig settings. This maintains consistency so we can see in the diffs what changed. There is also a ESLint configuration in the project for other settings like semicolon rules etc.
